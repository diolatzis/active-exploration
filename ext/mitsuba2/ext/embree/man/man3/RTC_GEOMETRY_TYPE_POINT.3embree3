.SS DESCRIPTION
.PP
Points with per vertex radii are supported with sphere, ray\-oriented
discs, and normal\-oriented discs geometric representations.
Such point geometries are created by passing
\f[C]RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_SPHERE_POINT\f[],
\f[C]RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_DISC_POINT\f[], or
\f[C]RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_ORIENTED_DISC_POINT\f[] to the
\f[C]rtcNewGeometry\f[] function.
The point vertices can be specified t through a vertex buffer
(\f[C]RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_VERTEX\f[]).
For the normal oriented discs a normal buffer
(\f[C]RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_NORMAL\f[]) has to get specified additionally.
See \f[C]rtcSetGeometryBuffer\f[] and
\f[C]rtcSetSharedGeometryBuffer\f[] for more details on how to set
buffers.
.PP
The vertex buffer stores each control vertex in the form of a single
precision position and radius stored in (\f[C]x\f[], \f[C]y\f[],
\f[C]z\f[], \f[C]r\f[]) order in memory (\f[C]RTC_FORMAT_FLOAT4\f[]
format).
The number of vertices is inferred from the size of this buffer.
Similarly, the normal buffer stores a single precision normal per
control vertex (\f[C]x\f[], \f[C]y\f[], \f[C]z\f[] order and
\f[C]RTC_FORMAT_FLOAT3\f[] format).
.PP
In the \f[C]RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_SPHERE_POINT\f[] mode, a real geometric
surface is rendered for the curve, which is more expensive but allows
closeup views.
.PP
The \f[C]RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_DISC_POINT\f[] flat mode is a fast mode
designed to render distant points.
In this mode the point is rendered as a ray facing disc.
.PP
The \f[C]RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_ORIENTED_DISC_POINT\f[] mode is a mode
designed as a midpoint geometrically between ray facing discs and
spheres.
In this mode the point is rendered as a normal oriented disc.
.PP
For all point types, only the hit distance and geometry normal is
returned as hit information, u and v are set to zero.
.PP
For multi\-segment motion blur, the number of time steps must be first
specified using the \f[C]rtcSetGeometryTimeStepCount\f[] call.
Then a vertex buffer for each time step can be set using different
buffer slots, and all these buffers must have the same stride and size.
.PP
Also see tutorial [Points] for an example of how to create and use point
geometries.
.SS EXIT STATUS
.PP
On failure \f[C]NULL\f[] is returned and an error code is set that can
be queried using \f[C]rtcGetDeviceError\f[].
