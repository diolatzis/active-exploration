.SS DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[C]rtcGetGeometry\f[] function returns the geometry that is bound
to the specified geometry ID (\f[C]geomID\f[] argument) for the
specified scene (\f[C]scene\f[] argument).
This function just looks up the handle and does \f[I]not\f[] increment
the reference count.
If you want to get ownership of the handle, you need to additionally
call \f[C]rtcRetainGeometry\f[].
For this reason, this function is fast and can be used during rendering.
However, it is generally recommended to store the geometry handle inside
the application\[aq]s geometry representation and look up the geometry
handle from that representation directly.
.SS EXIT STATUS
.PP
On failure \f[C]NULL\f[] is returned and an error code is set that can
be queried using \f[C]rtcGetDeviceError\f[].
