.SS DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[C]rtcGetSceneLinearBounds\f[] function queries the linear bounds
of the specified scene (\f[C]scene\f[] argument) and stores them to the
provided destination pointer (\f[C]bounds_o\f[] argument).
The stored linear bounds consist of bounding boxes for time 0
(\f[C]bounds0\f[] member) and time 1 (\f[C]bounds1\f[] member) as
specified by the \f[C]RTCLinearBounds\f[] structure.
Linearly interpolating these bounds to a specific time \f[C]t\f[] yields
bounds for the geometry at that time.
.PP
The provided destination pointer must be aligned to 16 bytes.
The function may be called only after committing the scene, otherwise
the result is undefined.
.SS EXIT STATUS
.PP
On failure an error code is set that can be queried using
\f[C]rtcGetDeviceError\f[].
