.SS DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[C]rtcIntersect1\f[] function finds the closest hit of a single
ray with the scene (\f[C]scene\f[] argument).
The provided ray/hit structure (\f[C]rayhit\f[] argument) contains the
ray to intersect and some hit output fields that are filled when a hit
is found.
.PP
The user has to initialize the ray origin (\f[C]org\f[] ray member), ray
direction (\f[C]dir\f[] ray member), ray segment (\f[C]tnear\f[],
\f[C]tfar\f[] ray members), and set the ray flags to \f[C]0\f[]
(\f[C]flags\f[] ray member).
If the scene contains motion blur geometries, also the ray time
(\f[C]time\f[] ray member) must be initialized to a value in the range
[0, 1].
If ray masks are enabled at compile time, the ray mask (\f[C]mask\f[]
ray member) must be initialized as well.
The ray segment has to be in the range [0, ∞], thus ranges that start
behind the ray origin are not valid, but ranges can reach to infinity.
See Section [RTCRay] for the ray layout description.
.PP
The geometry ID (\f[C]geomID\f[] hit member) of the hit data must be
initialized to \f[C]RTC_INVALID_GEOMETRY_ID\f[] (\-1).
.PP
Further, an intersection context for the ray query function must be
created and initialized (see \f[C]rtcInitIntersectContext\f[]).
.PP
When no intersection is found, the ray/hit data is not updated.
When an intersection is found, the hit distance is written into the
\f[C]tfar\f[] member of the ray and all hit data is set, such as
unnormalized geometry normal in object space (\f[C]Ng\f[] hit member),
local hit coordinates (\f[C]u\f[], \f[C]v\f[] hit member), instance ID
stack (\f[C]instID\f[] hit member), geometry ID (\f[C]geomID\f[] hit
member), and primitive ID (\f[C]primID\f[] hit member).
See Section [RTCHit] for the hit layout description.
.PP
If the instance ID stack has a prefix of values not equal to
\f[C]RTC_INVALID_GEOMETRY_ID\f[], the instance ID on each level
corresponds to the geometry ID of the hit instance of the higher\-level
scene, the geometry ID corresponds to the hit geometry inside the hit
instanced scene, and the primitive ID corresponds to the n\-th primitive
of that geometry.
.PP
If level 0 of the instance ID stack is equal to
\f[C]RTC_INVALID_GEOMETRY_ID\f[], the geometry ID corresponds to the hit
geometry inside the top\-level scene, and the primitive ID corresponds
to the n\-th primitive of that geometry.
.PP
The implementation makes no guarantees that primitives whose hit
distance is exactly at (or very close to) \f[C]tnear\f[] or
\f[C]tfar\f[] are hit or missed.
If you want to exclude intersections at \f[C]tnear\f[] just pass a
slightly enlarged \f[C]tnear\f[], and if you want to include
intersections at \f[C]tfar\f[] pass a slightly enlarged \f[C]tfar\f[].

.SS EXIT STATUS
.PP
For performance reasons this function does not do any error checks, thus
will not set any error flags on failure.
